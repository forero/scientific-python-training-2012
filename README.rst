STSCI's Scientific Python Course 2012
=====================================

Introduction
------------

This is a data-oriented approach to Python. The focus is on showing one how to
quickly get up and running reading, manipulating and displaying data learning
the minimum amount of Python initially. Gradually, more Python language is
introduced as more complex examples are worked through.

No Python background is required.

Schedule
--------

Session 1: Nov. 28

Information on Scientific Python
--------------------------------

There are many sources of information. That's sometime part of the problem (as
compared to integrated tools like IDL or IRAF).

Using Python for Astronomy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `AstroPy <http://www.astropy.org>`_:
  relatively new; software specifically for astronomy (with documentation)
- `Using Python for Interactive Data Analysis
  <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/perry/pydatatut.pdf>`_: short book by STSCI/SSB
- `Python4Astronomers <http://python4astronomers.github.com/>`_:
  tutorials by CfA

Using Python for Science and Engineering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Numpy and SciPy <http://scipy.org>`_: general website containing software
  and documentation for scientific python
- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_: 2-d plotting (and some 3-d capability)
- `IPython <http://ipython.org>`_: enhanced interactive python environments

Books
~~~~~

- A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python by Hans Petter Langtangen
  (Also: Python Scripting for Computational Science)
- Beginning Python Visualization: Crafting Visual Transformation Scripts
  by Shai Vaingast
- Matplotlib for Python Developers by Sandro Tosi
- Numpy 1.5 Beginner's Guide by Ivan Idris
- Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python by Jaan Kiusalaas

There are a large number of books about Python.

Python 2 vs. Python 3
---------------------

These two versions of Python differ in non-trivial ways. Eventually we expect
that we will migrate to Python 3 (the process has been underway for a while),
but we expect it will still be a couple years before a significant number of
science users will be using Python 3. This course will use only Python 2 for
all its examples. Discussions regarding the differences are beyond the scope of
this course.
